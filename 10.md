NUT-10: Spending conditions
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

An ordinary ecash token is a set of `Proofs` each with a random string `secret`. To spend such a token in a [split][06] or a [melt][05] operation, wallets include `proofs` in their request each with a unique `secret`. To autorize a transaction, the mind requires that the `secret` has not been seen before. This is the most fundamental spending condition in Cashu, which ensures that a token can't be double-spent. 

In this NUT, we explain how a `secret` can also encode more complex spending conditions that need to be met before the mint authorizes a transaction.

## Well-known Secret

Spending conditions are expressed in a well-known secret format that is revealed to the mint when spending (unlocking) a token, not when the token is minted (locked). The mint parses each `Proof`'s `secret`. If it can deserialize it into the following format, and if all `Proofs` have the same `kind`, it executes additional spending conditions that are further specified below.

The well-known `Secret` stored in `Proof.secret` is a JSON of the format:

```json
[
kind <str>, 
  {
    "nonce": <str>,
    "data": <str>,
    "tags": [[ "key", "value"],  ... ], // (optional)
  }
]
```

- `kind` is the kind of the spending condition, currently: `P2PK` or `P2SH`
- `nonce` is a unique random string
- `data` expresses the spending condition specific to each kind
- `tags` hold additional data  commited to and can be used for feature extensions
 

## Pay-to-Pubkey

`kind: P2PK`

If for a `Proof`, `Proof.secret` is a `Secret` of kind `P2PK`, the proof must be unlocked by providing one or more valid signatures in the field `Proof.p2pksigs`. 

In the basic case, the mint requires a valid Schnorr signature `Proof.p2pksigs` on `Proof.secret` by the public key in `Proof.Secret.data`. 

An example `Secret` that achieves this is:
```json
[
"P2PK", 
  {
    "nonce": "5d11913ee0f92fefdc82a6764fd2457a",
    "data": "026562efcfadc8e86d44da6a8adf80633d974302e62c850774db1fb36ff4cc7198",
  }
]
```

The example of a signed `Proof` with this `Secret` serialized to a string is then 

```json
{
  "amount": 8, 
  "secret": '["P2PK",{"nonce": "5d11913ee0f92fefdc82a6764fd2457a","data": "026562efcfadc8e86d44da6a8adf80633d974302e62c850774db1fb36ff4cc7198",}]',
  "C": "02250a37a56b78e66674f7f063e6abd3d9345f8761fb90cac0293108910a8c27a3",
  "id": "1cCNIAZ2X/w1",
  "p2pksigs":
    [
      "c43d0090be59340a6364dc1340876211f2173d6a21c391115adf097adb6ea0a3ddbe7fd81b4677281decc77be09c0359faa77416025130e487f8b9169eb0c609"
    ]
}
```

As a mental model, one can view the `secret` as analogous to a Bitcoin transaction's `scriptPubKey` and `p2pksigs` as a `scriptSig` (or a witness).

#### Signature scheme

To spend a token locked with `P2PK`, the spender needs to include signatures in the request. We use Schnorr signatures on the SHA256 hash of the message to sign. We sign the fields `Proof.secret` (as the inputs) and `BlindedMessage.B_` (if the outputs also require a signature).

An ecash spending operation like `/split` and `/melt` can have multiple inputs and outputs. If we have more than one input or output we provide signatures on them on all `Proof.secret` and `BlindedMessage.B_` individually. The inputs are the `Proofs` provided in the `proofs` field and the outputs are the `BlindedMessages` in the `outputs` field, (see `PostMeltRequest` in [NUT-05][05] and `PostSplitRequest` in [NUT-06][06]). 

### Tags
Additional and more complex spending conditions can be defined in the tags in `Proof.tags`. All tags are optional. Tags are arrays with two strings being `["key", "value"]`.

Supported tags are:

- `sigflag: str` determines whether outputs have to be signed as well
- `n_sigs: uint` specifies the minimum number of valid signatures expected 
- `pubkey: hex_str` are additional public keys that can provide signatures
- `locktime: uint` is the Unix timestamp of when the lock expires
- `refund: hex_str` is an optional refund public key that can exclusively spend after `locktime`

**Note:** The tag serialization type is `[<str>, <str>]` but some tag values are `int`. Wallets and mints must cast types appropriately for de/serialization.

#### Signature flags
Signature flags are defined in the tag `Secret.tags['sigflag']`. Currently, there are two signature flags. Signature flags are only enforced if all `Proofs` and if applicable all `BlindedMessages` have the same signature flag.


- `SIG_INPUTS` requires valid signatures on all inputs. It is the default signature flag and will be applied even if the `sigflag` tag is absent.
- `SIG_ALL` requires valid signatures on all inputs and on all outputs.

#### Signature

Signatures must be provided in the field `Proof.p2pksigs` for each `Proof` which is an input. If the signature flags `Proof.sigflag` of all `Proofs` is `SIG_ALL`, signatures must also be provided for every output in its field `BlindedMessage.p2pksigs`.

##### Signed inputs
A `Proof` with a signature `p2pksigs` on `secret` is the JSON (see [NUT-00][00]):
```json
{
  "amount": int, 
  "secret": str,
  "C": hex_str,
  "id": str | None,
  "p2pksigs": [<str>] // Array! signatures on "secret"
}
```

##### Signed outputs
A `BlindesMessage` with a signature `p2pksigs` on `B_` is the JSON (see [NUT-00][00]):

```json
{
  "amount": int,
  "B_": hex_str,
  "p2pksigs": [<str>] // Array! signatures on "B_"
}
```

### Multisig
If the tag `n_sigs` is a positive integer, the mint will also consider signatures from public keys specified in one or more tags `pubkey` additional to the public key in `Secret.data`. If the number of valid signatures if greater or equal `n_sigs`, the transaction is valid.

Expressed as an "n-of-m" scheme, `n = n_sigs` is the number of required signatures and `m = 1 ("data" field) + len(pubkey tags)` is the number of public keys that could sign.

### Locktime
If the tag `locktime` is the unix time and the mint's local clock is greater than `locktime`, the `Proof` becomes spendable by anyone, except if the following condition is also true.

#### Refund public key
If the `locktime` is in the past and a tag `refund` is present, the `Proof` is spendable only if a valid signature by the `refund` pubkey is provided in `Proof.p2pksigs` and, depending on the signature flag, in `BlindedMessage.p2pksigs`.

#### Complex Example

This is an example `secret` that locks a `Proof` with a Pay-to-Pubkey (P2PK) condition that requires a 2-of-3 signature from the first public key in the `data` field, and the second public key in the `pubkey` tag. If the `timelock` is passed, the `Proof` becomes spendable with a single signature from the public key in the `refund` tag. The signature flag `sigflag` indicates that signatures are necessary on the `Proofs` and the `BlindMessages` of a transaction.

```json
[
  "P2PK",
  {
    "nonce": "da62796403af76c80cd6ce9153ed3746",
    "data": "033281c37677ea273eb7183b783067f5244933ef78d8c3f15b1a77cb246099c26e",

      ]      
    ]
  }
