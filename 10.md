NUT-10: Spending conditions
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

An ordinary ecash token is a set of `Proofs` each with a random string `secret`. To spend such a token in a [split][06] or a [melt][05] operation, wallets include `proofs` in their request each with a unique `secret`. To autorize a transaction, the mint requires that the `secret` has not been seen before. This is the most fundamental spending condition in Cashu, which ensures that a token can't be double-spent. 

In this NUT, we explain how a `secret` can also encode more complex spending conditions that need to be met before the mint authorizes a transaction.

## Basic components
An ecash transaction, i.e., a [split][06] or a [melt][05] operation, with a spending condition consists of the following components:

- inputs referring to the `Proofs` being spent
- `Secret` containing the rules for unlocking a `Proof`
- signatures or additional witness data satisfying the unlock conditions
- outputs referring to the `BlindMessages` with new unlock conditions to which the `Proofs` are spent to

Spending conditions are defined for each individual `Proof` and not on a transaction level that can consist of multiple `Proofs`. Similarly, spending conditions must be satisfied by providing signatures or additional witness data for each `Proof` separately. For a transaction to be valid, all `Proofs` in that transaction must be unlocked successfully.

New `Secret`s of the outputs to which the inputs are spent to are provided as `BlindMessages` which means that they are blind-signed and not visible to the mint until they are actually spent.

## Well-known Secret

Spending conditions are expressed in a well-known secret format that is revealed to the mint when spending (unlocking) a token, not when the token is minted (locked). The mint parses each `Proof`'s `secret`. If it can deserialize it into the following format, and if all `Proofs` have the same `kind`, it executes additional spending conditions that are further specified below.

The well-known `Secret` stored in `Proof.secret` is a JSON of the format:

```json
[
kind <str>, 
  {
    "nonce": <str>,
    "data": <str>,
    "tags": [[ "key", "value"],  ... ], // (optional)
  }
]
```

- `kind` is the kind of the spending condition, currently: `P2PK` or `P2SH`
- `nonce` is a unique random string
- `data` expresses the spending condition specific to each kind
- `tags` hold additional data committed to and can be used for feature extensions
